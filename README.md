## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The **Deposit Subscription Predictor** is a data science and machine learning project that offers a comprehensive solution to a significant challenge faced by a major financial institution. It centers around a dataset derived from direct marketing campaigns, specifically telephone-based outreach, conducted by the bank to promote a "term deposit" product. Term deposits are financial instruments that can only be withdrawn upon reaching a specified term or maturity date, offering typically higher interest rates compared to regular demand deposits.
