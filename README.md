## ðŸš€ Overview

The **Marketing Outcome Predictor** is a project that centers around a dataset derived from direct marketing campaigns, specifically telephone-based outreach, conducted by the bank to promote a "term deposit" product. Term deposits are financial instruments that can only be withdrawn upon reaching a specified term or maturity date, offering typically higher interest rates compared to regular demand deposits. The goal of this project is to determine the ideal client to target for this marketing campaign, and to produce the best model in order to predict if a client is going to subscribe to the product or not.

### ðŸ“Š Key Components

- **Jupyter Notebook**: This notebook provides valuable insights on the marketing campaign. It finds the ideal candidate to target for the campaign and offers model configurations in order to predict if a client is going to subscribe to the product or not.

- **Interactive Streamlit App**: This app allows you to quickly try out different model configurations, and visualize the data through an interactive web application. This user-friendly tool offers real-time predictions and serves as a prototype for potential integration into the bank's marketing operations.
